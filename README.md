## Description

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle, also known by a few other names, that originated in 1883, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. This project is a popular way of practicing recursion in programming to come up with a solution to the puzzle in a relatively short amount of time. In this instance, an animated demo of building the Tower of Hanoi is showing, using recursion in JavaScript.

All of the code in `hanoi.js` and most of the code in `tower.js` was provided by Professor John Williams. To further develop the code, I added a `select` menu to gather user input specifying the number of disks to place on the tower. I also added a `setTimeout` function to animate the tower being built so that the user doesn't have to click each disk move.

## How to Run

- Download the repository on your machine as a zip file.
- Unzip the file.
- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Choose the number of disks from the dropdown menu.
- Press the button to start the animation and build the Tower of Hanoi.
- Reload the page to reset and start over.

You can also see a working demo <a href="https://lkmitx.github.io/tower-of-hanoi/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Further development of this repository could include the following:

- [ ] Allow user to choose whether to click through one disk movement at a time or to animate the entire sequence.
- [ ] Allow user to control the speed of the animation.
- [ ] Allow user to pause the animation.
- [ ] Allow user to reset the tower back to the starting point by clicking a button instead of reloading the page.
- [ ] Consider doing something interesting with the sequence of moves... not sure what that might be, at the moment.
